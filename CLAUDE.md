# Shaperail — AI-Native Rust Backend Framework

## What We Are Building
This repo IS the framework itself. We are building the tool that gets published
to crates.io so others can install it with `cargo install shaperail-cli`.

The end-user experience we are building toward:
```bash
cargo install shaperail-cli
shaperail init my-app
cd my-app && shaperail serve   # full working API, zero boilerplate
```

## Main Goal
Make Shaperail the backend framework that an LLM can use with very low mistake
rates. A model trained on Shaperail docs, or given Shaperail docs in-context, should be
able to generate valid resources, config, and commands on the first pass.

## Core Value
Shaperail gives users a small, explicit schema language that expands into a
production-ready Rust backend. The value is not flexibility through many
equivalent options. The value is correctness through one canonical way,
deterministic generation, and loud failure on invalid input.

## What AI-First Means Here
- One canonical syntax per concept
- Docs, scaffolds, parser, codegen, and runtime must match exactly
- Unknown or unsupported fields must fail clearly
- Common CRUD and API tasks should take very few tokens
- Explicit declarations beat implicit framework behavior
- If docs and code disagree, fix the disagreement immediately

## Crate Responsibilities
- `shaperail-core`    → ResourceDefinition, FieldType, ShaperailError, all shared traits
- `shaperail-codegen` → YAML parser + Rust/SQL/OpenAPI generator
- `shaperail-runtime` → Actix-web server, handlers, middleware, DB, Redis, jobs
- `shaperail-cli`     → `shaperail` binary — the developer-facing tool

## Five Design Rules (NEVER violate — enforced by /run-checks)
1. ONE WAY — no aliases, no alternative syntax, no shortcuts
2. EXPLICIT OVER IMPLICIT — nothing executes unless declared in the resource file
3. FLAT ABSTRACTION — resource (layer 1) maps to runtime (layer 2). Max depth: 2
4. SCHEMA IS SOURCE OF TRUTH — generate all code FROM schema, never reverse
5. COMPILER AS SAFETY NET — every generated Rust file must compile + pass clippy

## Exact Resource File Format (from PRD — this is what users write)
```yaml
resource: users       # "resource:" key, not "name:"
version: 1            # drives route prefix: /v1/...

schema:
  id:        { type: uuid, primary: true, generated: true }
  email:     { type: string, format: email, unique: true, required: true }
  name:      { type: string, min: 1, max: 200, required: true }
  role:      { type: enum, values: [admin, member, viewer], default: member }
  org_id:    { type: uuid, ref: organizations.id, required: true }
  created_at: { type: timestamp, generated: true }
  updated_at: { type: timestamp, generated: true }

# All paths below are auto-prefixed with /v{version} (e.g. /v1/users)
# Convention-based defaults: for list/get/create/update/delete,
# method and path are inferred automatically. Override only if needed.
endpoints:
  list:
    auth: [member, admin]
    filters: [role, org_id]
    search: [name, email]
    pagination: cursor
    cache: { ttl: 60 }

  create:
    auth: [admin]
    input: [email, name, role, org_id]
    controller: { before: validate_org }   # replaces hooks — see resources/users.controller.rs
    events: [user.created]
    jobs: [send_welcome_email]

  update:
    auth: [admin, owner]
    input: [name, role]

  delete:
    auth: [admin]
    soft_delete: true

relations:
  organization: { resource: organizations, type: belongs_to, key: org_id }
  orders:       { resource: orders, type: has_many, foreign_key: user_id }

indexes:
  - fields: [org_id, role]
  - fields: [created_at], order: desc
```

## Performance Targets (PRD-mandated — must pass benchmarks before release)
- Simple JSON response: 150,000+ req/s
- DB read cached: 80,000+ req/s, P99 < 2ms
- DB write: 20,000+ req/s, P99 < 10ms
- Idle memory: ≤ 60 MB
- Release binary size: < 20 MB
- Cold start: < 100ms

## Success Metrics (PRD-mandated)
- ≥ 90% of generated endpoints compile + pass tests on first try
- ≤ 75% fewer tokens than Express/FastAPI for identical CRUD
- 100% auto-generated valid OpenAPI 3.1 specs
- `shaperail init myapp && cd myapp && shaperail serve` works end-to-end

## Docker Requirements (PRD-mandated)
- `docker compose up` → starts Postgres + Redis for local dev
- Framework CI runs inside Docker (no local Rust install needed)
- `shaperail build --docker` → produces scratch-based image ≤ 25 MB for user apps

## Release Targets
- `shaperail-core`, `shaperail-codegen`, `shaperail-runtime`, `shaperail-cli` published to crates.io
- GitHub Releases with pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, Windows
- Install script: `curl -fsSL https://shaperail.io/install.sh | sh`

## Commands
```bash
cargo build --workspace          # build all crates
cargo test --workspace           # run all tests (452 as of v0.6.0)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings      # lint — must pass before every commit
cargo fmt                        # format — run after every edit
cargo bench -p shaperail-runtime # run performance benchmarks (no DB needed)
docker compose up -d             # start dev postgres + redis
docker compose down              # stop dev services
```

## AI-Native CLI Commands
```bash
shaperail check [path] --json    # structured diagnostics with error codes + fix suggestions
shaperail explain <file>         # dry-run: shows routes, table, relations from a resource
shaperail diff                   # shows what codegen would change (dry-run diff)
shaperail export json-schema     # JSON Schema for resource YAML (IDE/LLM validation)
shaperail resource create <name> --archetype <type>  # archetypes: basic, user, content, tenant, lookup
```

## Key Docs
- agent_docs/architecture.md      → crate structure + boundaries
- agent_docs/resource-format.md   → exact YAML spec (match PRD exactly)
- agent_docs/codegen-patterns.md  → Rust code generation patterns
- agent_docs/hooks-system.md      → Controller system (before/after) + ControllerContext
- agent_docs/testing-strategy.md  → what to test at each layer
- agent_docs/docker.md            → Docker dev + CI + release image setup
- agent_docs/release.md           → crates.io publish + GitHub Releases

## Documentation Rule

After every code change that alters behavior, CLI commands, APIs, configuration, error semantics, or test infrastructure, update the relevant docs BEFORE committing:

- `docs/` — **user-facing public documentation** (rendered to https://shaperail.io). CLI reference, guides, examples, recipes. Has Jekyll front matter (`title`, `parent`, `nav_order`).
- `agent_docs/` — **internal developer docs** (architecture, testing strategy, codegen patterns, hooks system). No front matter.
- `CLAUDE.md` — **project-level conventions and workflows** (this file). Update when the change affects how future Claude sessions should approach the codebase.

If docs and code disagree, fix the disagreement immediately (AI-First rule).

### Public-mirror requirement

`docs/` and `agent_docs/` are not optional alternatives — they're parallel audiences. **Every behavior change documented in `agent_docs/X.md` MUST have a corresponding update in `docs/`**, either in an existing user-facing page or as a new mirror page (`docs/X.md`). The internal note isn't enough; users reading the public site at shaperail.io need the same information in public-voice form.

Concretely, the checklist when you finish a code change:

1. ✅ Code change committed with tests.
2. ✅ `agent_docs/<relevant>.md` updated.
3. ✅ **Corresponding `docs/<page>.md` updated** — either an existing page got a new section, or a new mirror page was created with Jekyll front matter. If no public page is appropriate, write a one-line justification in the commit message saying so (very rare — most user-visible changes belong in public docs).
4. ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` (or current version) section names the change.
5. ✅ If the change affects a release-process, validation rule, or codebase convention, update `CLAUDE.md`.

Examples of the mirror requirement in action:

| Change | `agent_docs/` page | `docs/` page |
|---|---|---|
| New runtime API (`Subject`, `Context.session`, `test_support`) | `agent_docs/auth-claims.md`, `agent_docs/custom-handlers.md`, `agent_docs/testing-strategy.md` | `docs/security.md`, `docs/custom-handlers.md`, `docs/testing.md` |
| Custom-handler body extraction (v0.11.2) | `agent_docs/custom-handlers.md` "Reading the request body" | `docs/custom-handlers.md` "Reading the request body" + callout in `docs/controllers.md` |
| New validator rule | `agent_docs/codegen-patterns.md` | inline note in `docs/resource-guide.md` |
| Breaking config change | `agent_docs/architecture.md` if structural | `docs/configuration.md` migration section |

When unsure where the public version belongs, default to creating a new `docs/<topic>.md` page with the same structure as `agent_docs/<topic>.md`, adapted for end-user voice (less internal jargon, more "how do I do this in my project" framing).

## Git Workflow
- Never start new feature work on `main`. Create and switch to a fresh branch first.
- Branch per milestone or feature: `git checkout -b feat/m01-core-types`
- Only commit when clippy + tests pass
- **Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) on every commit and every PR title.** This is mandatory — release-plz reads commit messages to compute the next version and to generate the CHANGELOG. Getting the prefix wrong means the release PR is wrong.
  - `feat: ...` → minor bump, listed under **Added** (e.g. `feat(shaperail-runtime): add SSE streaming for /events`)
  - `fix: ...` → patch bump, listed under **Fixed** (e.g. `fix(shaperail-codegen): prevent panic on empty enum`)
  - `feat!: ...` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the body → breaking (pre-1.0 minor, post-1.0 major)
  - `perf: ...` / `refactor: ...` → patch bump, listed under **Changed**
  - `chore: ...` / `docs: ...` / `style: ...` / `test: ...` / `ci: ...` / `build: ...` → bookkeeping, **does not trigger a release**
  - **Internal-scoped fixes do not trigger a release.** `fix(ci)`, `fix(release)`, `fix(deps)`, `fix(build)`, `fix(examples)` (and the same scopes with `feat`/`perf`/`refactor`) are skipped by the release-plz parsers. Use these scopes for plumbing changes that have no user-visible effect — e.g. fixing a workflow file, bumping a dev dependency, refreshing an example's lockfile.
  - Scope (the `(shaperail-core)` part) is optional but encouraged for crate-specific changes. Crate-name scopes (`shaperail-core`, `shaperail-codegen`, `shaperail-runtime`, `shaperail-cli`) on `fix:`/`feat:` commits **do** trigger releases — they signal user-facing crate changes.
  - PR titles MUST follow the same convention — auto-merge squashes the PR title into the merge commit, so the PR title is what release-plz sees.
- **Never push more commits to a branch with an open PR you intend to merge as-is.** PRs auto-merge as soon as CI is green; follow-up commits frequently land too late and end up stranded on the merged branch. Open a new PR for follow-ups.

## Release Process — release-plz

Releases are driven by [release-plz](https://release-plz.dev). On every push to `main`, `.github/workflows/release-plz.yml` does two things:

1. **Publish (if a release PR was just merged):** publishes all four crates to crates.io in dependency order, tags the commit `vX.Y.Z`, and creates a GitHub Release. `.github/workflows/release-binaries.yml` then fires on `release: published` and uploads archives for the five supported targets.
2. **Open or update the release PR:** scans new commits since the last tag and opens (or updates) a single PR titled `chore(release): X.Y.Z` containing the version bump and a generated CHANGELOG section.

The only manual step is reviewing and merging that release PR. There is **no** seven-place checklist, **no** manual `workflow_dispatch` button, and **no** local pre-release script.

**Conventional-commit titles drive the release.** Use them on every PR:

| Prefix | Effect |
|---|---|
| `feat: ...` | minor bump, listed under **Added** |
| `fix: ...` | patch bump, listed under **Fixed** |
| `feat!: ...` (or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in body) | breaking — pre-1.0 minor, post-1.0 major |
| `perf:` `refactor:` | patch bump, listed under **Changed** |
| `chore:` `docs:` `style:` `test:` `ci:` `build:` | bookkeeping — no release |

A merge consisting only of bookkeeping commits does not open a release PR. That is the intended behavior.

**Pre-1.0 semver convention this project uses:**
- Patch (`0.11.0` → `0.11.1`): bug fixes, additive non-breaking features, documentation.
- Minor (`0.11.x` → `0.12.0`): breaking API or behavior changes.
- A change behind an opt-in feature flag (e.g. `test-support`) that nobody could have realistically used yet → patch is acceptable; mark the commit `feat:` not `feat!:`.

**Reviewing the release PR:**
- Confirm the version bump matches the change scope (release-plz computes it from commits — sanity-check it).
- The generated CHANGELOG section follows Keep-a-Changelog with `Breaking` / `Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` subsections. Subsections with no entries are skipped.
- Hand-edits to the CHANGELOG inside the release PR branch are preserved — release-plz only regenerates if commits are added.
- Once a release is published, **never edit its CHANGELOG section** — it is frozen historical record.
- **Never merge a release PR with an empty changelog body.** If release-plz opens a `chore(release): X.Y.Z` PR whose body has no real entries (just `<details>...</details>` with blank lines), close it instead of merging — merging it ships an empty release that mislabels future user-facing changes. The `release_commits` regex in `release-plz.toml` is the primary guard against this, but treat the empty-body case as a final manual check.
- **If two release PRs are open at once, close the older one.** This can happen during a pipeline transition or when a `feat!:` lands while a patch-only release PR is already open. Keep only the PR with the correct target version; release-plz will re-sync on the next push.

**RUSTSEC advisories** must be either upgraded out (`cargo update -p <crate> --precise <version>`) or ignored in `.cargo/audit.toml` with a comment explaining the upstream block. `cargo audit` runs in `ci.yml` on every PR.

**Verifying the release shipped:**

```
gh run list --workflow release-plz.yml --limit 1        # publish run: completed/success
gh run list --workflow release-binaries.yml --limit 1   # binaries run: completed/success
gh release view vX.Y.Z                                   # tag exists, 5 binaries attached
cargo install shaperail-cli@X.Y.Z                        # crates.io has it
```

Cross-platform binaries take ~15 minutes (Windows MSVC is the long pole). crates.io publish completes earlier, so `cargo install` works before the GitHub Release page shows binaries.

Configuration lives in `release-plz.toml` at the repo root. Required GitHub secret: `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` with publish scope for all four crates.

**Internal crate version pins live ONLY in `[workspace.dependencies]` in the root `Cargo.toml`.** Each consumer's `[dependencies]` section uses `<crate>.workspace = true` to inherit. Do not add explicit `version = "..."` pins on `shaperail-*` deps in any consumer crate — release-plz's per-crate analysis can leave such pins stale when `version_group = "workspace"` lifts a crate that had no commits of its own, causing `cargo update` to fail with "candidate versions found which didn't match: X.Y.Z". One-place inheritance sidesteps this.

**Do NOT set `release_always = false` in `release-plz.toml`.** It blocks the publish step on commits that weren't merged through a release-plz-generated PR (e.g. manual version bumps), so a stuck release becomes "skipping release: current commit is not from a release PR". Empty release PRs are already prevented by the `release_commits` regex; we don't need this flag.

**Do NOT use `{{ version }}` in `pr_name` in `release-plz.toml`.** The variable is only populated when every crate in the workspace has the same next version, but that is not always true mid-computation. A crate whose only change is a `dependencies changed` bump (e.g. `shaperail-cli` when only the lib crates have `feat!:` commits) gets its next version computed independently before `version_group = "workspace"` lifts it. The `pr_name` template renders during that intermediate state, so `{{ version }}` is undefined and the workflow fails with `Variable 'version' not found in context while rendering 'pr_name'`. Use a literal title (`pr_name = "chore(release): version bump"`); the body still lists each crate with its bumped version. v0.12.0 hit this and stranded the workflow until the literal-title fix landed.

**A `feat!:` (or `fix:`/`perf:`/`refactor:`) commit's scope must match files actually touched.** release-plz attributes commits to crates by file path, not by the conventional-commit scope tag. A commit titled `feat(shaperail-cli)!: ...` that only edits files in `examples/` is NOT counted as a release-relevant commit for `shaperail-cli`, so cli ends up with a "dependencies changed" bump (patch) instead of joining the workspace breaking-bump. The bookkeeping cost is small (release-plz lifts cli via `version_group`), but it can cascade into title-rendering failures (see above). When a change touches only example or doc files, prefer scopes from the skip list: `feat(examples)!:` or `chore(examples):`.
